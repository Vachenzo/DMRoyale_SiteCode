<p>So last month I made a whole <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques/comments/3id92t/a_dd_character_sheet_and_campaign_manager/?ref=share&ref_source=link" target="_blank">bunch</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques/comments/3j3xkb/website_dd_character_sheet_and_campaign_manager/?ref=share&ref_source=link" target="_blank">posts</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonsAndDragons/comments/3j47a5/dd_character_sheet_and_campaign_manager/?ref=share&ref_source=link" target="_blank">Reddit</a> about the site. My main goal was to seek out advice from users familiar with web development, design and folks familiar with D&D. Specifically, the 5e flavor. I got a huge amount of feedback, some of which was incredibly valuable. I've done my best to implement changes that seemed they would improve the site and learned a whole bunch of new stuff in the process. The key take away here is that if I want this thing to be successful, it needs to be more convenient than the paper on the table in front of you. Which is pretty damn convenient already. Well, this can only get better from here!</p>
