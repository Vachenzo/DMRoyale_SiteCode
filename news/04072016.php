<p>It's been a long time since I've updated the site, but I wanted to give an update for what's been going down. I've been trying to implement an asychronous update system for the character sheet which would (in theory) severely reduce the need for you to keep hitting that update button. The idea is it woul dmake your life easier when updating the character sheet with more current information. That said, it's proving troublesome so I'm taking a few steps to make future development a bit easier. These steps are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Drastically reduce the number of tables on a page and convert them into more flexible DIVs,</li>
	<li>Remove and reduce features which serve little actual benefit to the player,</li>
	<li>Remove and reduce vestigial code leftover from the dark early days of development,</li>
	<li>Clean up the code to make it more readable and easier to update,</li>
	<li>Make the layout look nicer on all platforms, mobile included.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that's what I have been working on slowly. There should be some broken jankiness fixed as well. I apologize if that interupted your experience with the character sheet. Hopefully I can get something cool working and implement it soon.</p>
