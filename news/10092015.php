<h2 id="10092015">October 9, 2015</h2>
<p>So it's a new week and I haven't made a huge amount of progress updating and fixing the site. That said, I made a <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonsAndDragons/comments/3mzlxd/need_feedback_on_a_dd_character_sheet_and/'>couple</a> <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques/comments/3mzjts/website_a_dd_character_sheet_and_campaign_manager/'>more</a> posts to Reddit about the current state of the site and got some amazing feedback! I also had the opportunity to play another session of 5e over the last weekend and got to see how DMRoyale performs in an actual real-world session. So far, I think it works pretty great! I also came up with a whole bunch of ideas and features which would make the experience even easier and better for the user. So, I've got a long list of to-dos which I'll be knocking out over the next week or two. Until then, here are the latest bug fixes and new features as of 10/09/2015.</p>
